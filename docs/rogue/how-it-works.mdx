## Client-Server Architecture

Rogue operates on a **client-server architecture** that separates the core evaluation logic from the user interfaces:

- **Rogue Server**: The backend that handles all evaluation logic, scenario generation, red teaming, and agent interactions
- **Multiple Client Interfaces**: Different ways to interact with the server:
  - **TUI (Terminal UI)**: Modern terminal interface built with Go and Bubble Tea
  - **Web UI**: Gradio-based web interface for browser-based interaction
  - **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation and CI/CD pipelines

This architecture allows for flexible deployment patterns where the server can run independently, and multiple clients can connect simultaneously.

## Two Evaluation Modes

Rogue offers two complementary evaluation modes:

### 1. Policy Evaluation

Tests whether your agent follows its intended business logic and policies.

**Workflow:**

1. **Configure**: Provide agent endpoint, authentication, and LLM settings
2. **Generate Scenarios**: Input business context to auto-generate test scenarios
3. **Run & Evaluate**: EvaluatorAgent conducts conversations for each scenario
4. **View Report**: Get a summary of policy compliance with pass/fail rates

### 2. Red Team Security Testing

Tests your agent's resistance to adversarial attacks and security vulnerabilities.

**Workflow:**

1. **Configure**: Select scan type (Basic, Full, or Custom) and target vulnerabilities
2. **Attack Execution**: Red Team Orchestrator applies 30+ attack techniques
3. **Evaluate Responses**: LLM judges detect successful exploits
4. **Risk Assessment**: Calculate CVSS-based scores and map to compliance frameworks

## Red Team Scan Types

| Scan Type | Vulnerabilities | Attacks | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Basic** | 10 (Prompt + PII) | 5 free | Quick security check |
| **Full** | 87+ (all categories) | 30+ (all) | Comprehensive audit |
| **Custom** | User-selected | User-selected | Targeted testing |

## Evaluation Workflow (Policy)

1.  **Configure**: You provide the endpoint and authentication details for the agent you want to test, and select the LLMs you want Rogue to use for its services (scenario generation, judging).

2.  **Generate Scenarios**: You input the "business context" or a high-level description of what your agent is supposed to do. Rogue's `LLM Service` uses this context to generate a list of relevant test scenarios. You can review and edit these scenarios.

3.  **Run & Evaluate**: You start the evaluation. The `Scenario Evaluation Service` spins up the `EvaluatorAgent`, which begins a conversation with your agent for each scenario. You can watch this conversation happen live through the TUI or Web UI.

4.  **View Report**: Once all scenarios are complete, the `LLM Service` analyzes the results and generates a Markdown-formatted report, giving you a clear summary of your agent's performance.

## Red Team Workflow

1. **Select Scan Type**: Choose Basic (free), Full (premium), or Custom
2. **Configure Vulnerabilities**: Select from 87+ vulnerability types across 13 categories
3. **Select Attacks**: Choose from 30+ attack techniques (single-turn, multi-turn, agentic)
4. **Run Red Team**: Orchestrator systematically tests each vulnerability
5. **Evaluate Results**: LLM judges determine if attacks succeeded
6. **Calculate Risk**: CVSS-based scoring with severity levels
7. **Generate Report**: Compliance mapping to OWASP, MITRE, NIST, and more

## Interface Options

- **Default Mode**: `uvx rogue-ai` starts both server and TUI for immediate use
- **Web UI Mode**: `uvx rogue-ai ui` for browser-based interaction (requires server running)
- **CLI Mode**: `uvx rogue-ai cli` for automated testing and CI/CD integration
- **Server Only**: `uvx rogue-ai server` to run just the backend for custom integrations
