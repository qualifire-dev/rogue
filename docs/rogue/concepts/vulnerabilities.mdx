## Default Attack Mappings

Each vulnerability has default attacks that are most effective:

```python
# Example: prompt-extraction vulnerability
default_attacks = [
    "prompt-probing",     # Direct probing questions
    "system-override",    # Override commands
    "gray-box",          # Fake internal context
    "base64",            # Encoded requests
    "rot13"              # Obfuscated requests
]
```

## Accessing the Catalog

```python
from rogue.server.red_teaming.catalog.vulnerabilities import (
    get_vulnerability,
    get_all_vulnerabilities,
    get_vulnerabilities_by_category,
    get_free_vulnerabilities,
    get_premium_vulnerabilities,
    get_basic_scan_vulnerabilities,
    get_full_scan_vulnerabilities
)

# Get a specific vulnerability
vuln = get_vulnerability("prompt-extraction")
print(f"{vuln.name}: {vuln.description}")

# Get all free vulnerabilities
free_vulns = get_free_vulnerabilities()

# Get vulnerabilities for basic scan
basic_vulns = get_basic_scan_vulnerabilities()
```

## Vulnerability Definition Structure

```python
@dataclass
class VulnerabilityDef:
