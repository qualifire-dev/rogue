The AI Interviewer in Rogue is designed to streamline the process of creating a robust business context for generating test scenarios. Instead of requiring you to write the context from scratch, it engages you in a brief, targeted conversation to extract the necessary information.

## The Interview Process

The interviewer's goal is to understand your AI agent's function, its workflows, and potential risks as efficiently as possible. The process generally follows these steps:

1.  **Introduction**: The interviewer will introduce itself and ask a broad opening question about your agent's primary purpose.

2.  **Analysis and Follow-up**: After each of your responses, the AI analyzes the information. It then asks concise follow-up questions to probe deeper into areas that need clarification, focusing on:

    - **Edge Cases**: Situations that are unusual or at the limits of the agent's expected operation.
    - **Happy and Sad Flows**: The ideal user journey versus paths where things go wrong (e.g., errors, invalid requests).
    - **Key Business Risks**: Critical areas where failure would have significant consequences, such as handling refunds, discounts, or sensitive data.

3.  **Concise Questioning**: The interview is designed to be quick. The interviewer will ask a short series of targeted questions (typically 3-5) to gather the necessary details. It avoids repeating questions or asking for information you've already provided.

4.  **Context Summarization**: Once it has enough information, the interviewer synthesizes the key points into a comprehensive business context summary.

5.  **User Review and Confirmation**: The interviewer presents the summarized context to you for review. You have the opportunity to make corrections or additions. The context is updated with your feedback.

6.  **Conclusion**: Once you confirm the business context is accurate, the interview concludes, and you can proceed to generate test scenarios based on it.

This guided process ensures that all critical aspects of your agent's behavior are captured, leading to a more effective and comprehensive evaluation.
