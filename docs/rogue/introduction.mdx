## Architecture

Rogue operates on a **client-server architecture**:

- **Rogue Server**: Contains the core evaluation logic including the Red Team Orchestrator
- **Client Interfaces**: Multiple interfaces that connect to the server:
  - **TUI (Terminal UI)**: Modern terminal interface built with Go and Bubble Tea
  - **Web UI**: Gradio-based web interface
  - **CLI**: Command-line interface for automated evaluation and CI/CD

This architecture allows for flexible deployment and usage patterns, where the server can run independently and multiple clients can connect to it simultaneously.

## Key Features

### Policy Evaluation
- **🔄 Dynamic Scenario Generation**: Automatically creates a comprehensive test suite from your high-level business context.
- **👀 Live Evaluation Monitoring**: Watch the interaction between the Evaluator and your agent in a real-time chat interface.
- **📊 Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a detailed summary of the evaluation, including pass/fail rates, key findings, and recommendations.

### Red Teaming & Security Testing
- **🛡️ 87+ Vulnerability Types**: Test against comprehensive vulnerability categories including prompt injection, PII exposure, content safety, bias, and more.
- **⚔️ 30+ Attack Techniques**: Single-turn, multi-turn, and agentic attacks including Base64 encoding, roleplay, social engineering, and advanced jailbreaking.
- **📋 Compliance Framework Mapping**: Automatically map findings to OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, GDPR, and more.
- **📈 CVSS-Based Risk Scoring**: Industry-standard risk scoring with severity levels, exploitability metrics, and remediation recommendations.

### Platform Capabilities
- **🤖 Broad Model Support**: Compatible with a wide range of models from providers like OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Anthropic.
- **🎯 Multiple Interfaces**: Choose from TUI, Web UI, or CLI interfaces depending on your workflow needs.
- **🚀 Easy Installation**: Get started quickly with `uvx rogue-ai` - no complex setup required.
