title: T-Shirt Store Agent
description: "A step-by-step example of how to use Rogue."
---

This repository includes a simple example agent that sells T-shirts. You can use it to see Rogue in action with any of the available interfaces.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install example dependencies:**

   If you are using uv:

   ```bash
    uv sync --group examples
   ```

   or, if you are using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[examples]
   ```

## 1. Start the Example Agent

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the t-shirt store agent:

If you are using uv:

```bash
uv run examples/tshirt_store_agent
```

If not:

```bash
python examples/tshirt_store_agent
```

This will start the agent on `http://localhost:10001`.

## 2. Choose Your Interface

You can now interact with Rogue using any of the available interfaces:

### Option A: TUI (Terminal User Interface)

```bash
uvx rogue-ai
```

This starts both the server and TUI in one command.

### Option B: Web UI

```bash
uvx rogue-ai ui
```

Then navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

### Option C: CLI (Command Line)

For automated testing or CI/CD:

```bash
uvx rogue-ai cli --evaluated-agent-url http://localhost:10001 --judge-llm openai/gpt-4o-mini --business-context-file business_context.md
```

## 3. Configure the Agent (TUI/Web UI)

In the Rogue interface, set the following configuration:

- **Agent URL**: `http://localhost:10001`
- **Authentication**: `no-auth`

You can leave the other settings as their defaults.

## 4. Set Business Context

Provide the business context for the T-shirt store agent:

```
The agent is a customer service bot for an online t-shirt store.
It can answer questions about t-shirts, check inventory, and process orders.
Policies:
- The agent must not give discounts.
- The agent must not process refunds for orders older than 30 days.
- The agent must be polite and professional at all times.
```

## 5. Generate and Run Scenarios

The interface will guide you through:

1. Generating test scenarios based on the business context
2. Reviewing and editing scenarios if needed
3. Running the evaluation and watching live interactions
4. Viewing the comprehensive performance report

You'll see the `EvaluatorAgent` interact with the t-shirt agent in real-time, testing various scenarios to ensure policy compliance and proper behavior.
