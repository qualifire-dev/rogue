Rogue is a powerful, tool designed to evaluate the performance, compliance, and reliability of AI agents. It pits a dynamic `EvaluatorAgent` against your agent using Google's A2A protocol, testing it with a range of scenarios to ensure it behaves exactly as intended.

## 🔥 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An API key for an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualifire-dev/rogue.git
    cd rogue
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    If you are using uv:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    Or, if you are using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

3.  **OPTIONALLY: Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys. Rogue uses `LiteLLM`, so you can set keys for various providers.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
    ```

### Running Rogue

Launch the Gradio web UI with the following command:

If you are using uv:

```bash
uv run -m rogue
```

If not:

```bash
python -m rogue
```

Navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) to begin.

## Example: Testing the T-Shirt Store Agent

This repository includes a simple example agent that sells T-shirts. You can use it to see Rogue in action.

1. **Install exmaple dependencies:**

   If you are using uv:

   ```bash
    uv sync --group examples
   ```

   or, if you are using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[examples]
   ```

2. **Start the example agent server** in a separate terminal:

   If you are using uv:

   ```bash
   uv run examples/tshirt_store_agent
   ```

   If not:

   ```bash
   python examples/tshirt_store_agent
   ```

   This will start the agent on `http://localhost:10001`.

3. **Configure Rogue** in the UI to point to the example agent:

   - **Agent URL**: `http://localhost:10001`
   - **Authentication**: `no-auth`

4. **Run the evaluation** and watch Rogue test the T-Shirt agent's policies!

### 📊 Config file

The config file is automatically generated when running the UI. \
We will check for a config file in `<workdir>/user_config.json` and use it if it exists. \
The config file is a JSON object that can contain all or a subset of the fields from the CLI arguments, except for `--config-file`. \
Other keys in the config file are ignored. \
Just remember to use snake_case keys. (e.g. `--evaluated-agent-url` becomes `evaluated_agent_url`).

### Notes

1. ⚠️ Either `--business-context` or `--business-context-file` must be provided.
2. ⚠️ Fields marked as Required are required unless supplied via the config file.

---

### Examples

### With only a config file:

with our business context located at `./.rogue/business_context.md`

#### `./.rogue/user_config.json`

```json
{
  "evaluated_agent_url": "http://localhost:10001",
  "judge_llm": "openai/o4-mini"
}
```

#### Execution

```bash
uv run -m rogue cli
```

### Same example without a config file:

#### Execution

```bash
uv run -m rogue cli \
    --evaluated-agent-url http://localhost:10001 \
    --judge-llm openai/o4-mini \
    --business-context-file './.rogue/business_context.md'
```

## How It Works

Rogue's workflow is designed to be simple and intuitive, managed entirely through its web interface.

1.  **Configure**: You provide the endpoint and authentication details for the agent you want to test, and select the LLMs you want Rogue to use for its services (scenario generation, judging).
2.  **Generate Scenarios**: You input the "business context" or a high-level description of what your agent is supposed to do. Rogue's `LLM Service` uses this context to generate a list of relevant test scenarios. You can review and edit these scenarios.
3.  **Run & Evaluate**: You start the evaluation. The `Scenario Evaluation Service` spins up the `EvaluatorAgent`, which begins a conversation with your agent for each scenario. You can watch this conversation happen live.
4.  **View Report**: Once all scenarios are complete, the `LLM Service` analyzes the results and generates a Markdown-formatted report, giving you a clear summary of your agent's performance.
